# TextAdventure
A text-based adventure game

This adventure was fun to work on. I did watch some YouTube videos on how to make the story work and how to add some flair. Enjoy!

# Overview

I worked on this program to learn how to utilize C# in programming.

This adventure was fun to work on. I did watch some YouTube videos on how to make the story work and how to add some flair.

My purpose for writing this software was to do something fun and learn at the same time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this software, I used the C# language in Visual Studio Code.

C# is a pretty straight forward programming language as soon as you get the hang of it. The only library I used was one that had to do with time so the the pauses would show up on the screen.
